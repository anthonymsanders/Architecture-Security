## Key Capabilities

- **Attack Surface Risk Management (ASRM)**: Continuous risk assessment across all surfaces with risk scoring and prioritized mitigations -- differentiating capability
- **Native XDR Sensors**: First-party products for endpoint, email, network, and cloud (broadest native coverage)
- **Companion AI**: AI assistant for natural language investigation and response guidance
- **Zero Trust Secure Access**: Built-in ZTNA capabilities integrated into the platform
- **Managed XDR**: 24/7 analyst support service
- **Virtual Patching**: Network-based protection for unpatched systems via TippingPoint/Deep Security

## Strengths

- Broadest native XDR coverage (endpoint + email + network + cloud) in a single vendor
- Native email security -- significant differentiator (correlates phishing/BEC directly into XDR)
- Native NDR (TippingPoint IPS + Deep Discovery network sandbox)
- ASRM goes beyond detection to proactive risk reduction
- Most flexible deployment model (cloud, on-prem, hybrid, air-gap)
- Strong virtual patching for legacy/unpatched systems
- Mature vendor (since 1988); large installed base
- Cost-effective for comparable coverage vs. premium vendors

## Weaknesses

- Brand perception / marketing often underestimated vs. CrowdStrike, SentinelOne
- Endpoint agent historically perceived as heavier (significantly improved)
- No dedicated standalone identity protection product (correlation-based)
- Cloud security may not match pure-play CNAPP leaders (Wiz, Prisma Cloud)
- Some legacy UI elements in certain modules
- Less North American enterprise market share

## Integration Ecosystem

- Native integration across all Trend Micro products (endpoint, email, network, cloud)
- Third-party ingestion and growing integration marketplace

- SOAR: XSOAR, Splunk SOAR, ServiceNow Security Operations
- REST APIs for custom integrations
- Managed XDR service available

## Ideal For

- Organizations wanting single-vendor coverage across endpoint, email, network, and cloud
- Environments requiring on-premises or hybrid deployment
- Budget-conscious enterprises needing broad XDR coverage
- Industries with legacy systems needing virtual patching (healthcare, manufacturing)
- Asia-Pacific, healthcare, and government sectors
