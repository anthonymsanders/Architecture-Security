## Product Portfolio (XDR Components)

| Component | Coverage Domain |
|-----------|----------------|
| Cortex XDR Agent | Endpoint (EPP + EDR for Windows, macOS, Linux) |
| Cortex XDR Pro | Adds network detection (via NGFW), 3rd-party ingestion, UEBA |
| Cortex XSIAM | Converged SIEM + SOAR + XDR + ASM platform |
| Cortex XSOAR | SOAR (market-leading, 700+ integrations) |
| Cortex Xpanse | Attack surface management |
| Prisma Cloud | Cloud security (CWPP + CSPM + CIEM) |
| WildFire | Cloud-based malware analysis sandbox |
| Cortex Copilot | AI assistant |

## Key Capabilities

- **Causality Analysis Engine**: Automatically stitches alerts into incidents, identifies root cause, shows full attack chain
- **Behavioral Threat Protection (BTP)**: Behavioral rules engine detecting threats based on chains of activity
- **WildFire Sandbox**: One of the most mature cloud sandboxing services (billions of samples)
- **XSIAM Convergence**: Converged platform replacing traditional SIEM
- **Forensics Module**: Deep host-level DFIR investigation built into XDR
- **Network Telemetry**: Deep correlation with Palo Alto NGFW and Prisma Access data

## Strengths

- Top MITRE ATT&CK scores (100% detection in multiple rounds, zero delays)
- Excellent causality chain visualization and root cause analysis
- WildFire sandbox is best-in-class
- Strong network detection for Palo Alto NGFW customers
- XSIAM for full SIEM replacement
- XSOAR is the market-leading SOAR platform (700+ integrations)
- Built-in forensics module

## Weaknesses

- Strongest value with Palo Alto ecosystem (NGFW, Prisma)
- No native email security (partner-dependent)
- XSIAM vs. Cortex XDR roadmap confusion
- Enterprise pricing is significant (especially XSIAM)
- Less brand recognition in endpoint-first deals vs. CrowdStrike/SentinelOne

## Integration Ecosystem

- Palo Alto ecosystem: NGFWs, Panorama, Prisma Access (SASE), Prisma Cloud, XSOAR, Xpanse
- Cortex XDR Pro and XSIAM ingest third-party logs (Syslog, CEF, LEEF)
- XSOAR: 700+ integrations, 1,000+ automation playbooks
- REST APIs for custom integrations
- Identity providers (Okta, Azure AD), email security (Proofpoint, Mimecast), ITSM (ServiceNow)

## Ideal For

- Organizations running Palo Alto NGFWs and Prisma products
- Enterprises wanting to replace SIEM with XSIAM
- Security teams needing deep forensic investigation capabilities
- Organizations prioritizing MITRE ATT&CK validated detection
